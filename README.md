# <p align="center">AirSync Python Library</p>

Extremely early testing of a Python Library compatible with the [AirSync Protocol](https://github.com/sameerasw/airsync-mac/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md), with the goal of building an Apple-like ecosystem between all your devices.

## Contributing
Due to the very early state, there isn't currently a library available on PyPI. If you would like to test and contribute, you can clone the repo, install the requirements.txt, and run the included example.

## Documentation
Coming soon!

## Credit
Thank you so much to [sameerasw](https://github.com/sameerasw) for making the macOS and Android app, protocol documentation, and being awesome to work with!
