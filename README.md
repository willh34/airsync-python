# <p align="center">AirSync Python Library</p>

Extremely early testing of a Python Library compatible with [AirSync](https://github.com/sameerasw/airsync-mac), with the goal of providing continuity on all platforms.

## Contributing
Due to the very early state, there isn't currently a library available on PyPI. If you would like to test and contribute, you can clone the repo, install the requirements.txt, and run the included example.

## Documentation
Coming soon!
